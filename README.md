# Current benchmarking frontend

A ReasonReact project for displaying benchmarking data contained in an Irmin
store. Interfacing with the Irmin store is done via GraphQL.

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm run server
# in a new tab
npm start
```

Open a new web page to `http://localhost:8000/`. Change any `.re` file in `src`
to see the page auto-reload. **You don't need any bundler when you're
developing**!
